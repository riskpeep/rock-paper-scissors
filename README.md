# rock-paper-scissors
A simple rock paper scissors game to play.

This game is a game built to learn the Rust programming language and a bit about game programming.
It is based heavily on the example game found in the rust book on rust-lang.org
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).  The commit history
even follows the major steps presented in the tutorial.
